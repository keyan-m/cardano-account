# Cardano Account: A Wallet-less Solution

An alternative solution to Cardano wallets to simplify the adoption by allowing
users to take custody of their digital assets with a username and
passwordâ€”similar to web2 conventions.

## How does it work?

By allocating a UTxO for each username, and storing the hash of a salted
password plus its nonce, a secure access to the funds (without leaking data)
can be provided.
