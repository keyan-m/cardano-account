# Cardano Account: A Wallet-less Solution

An alternate solution to Cardano wallets for simplifying the adoption by
allowing users to take custody of their ADA with a username and passwordâ€”similar
to web2 conventions.

## How does it work?

By allocating a UTxO for each username, withdrawals can be unlocked using an
ED25519 signature, where its key pair is generated using a nonce stored in the
datum (which comes from a spent UTxO in order to satisfy uniqueness and, to some
extent, randomness).

The contract only verifies the signature and doesn't care about the underlying
seed of the key pair. However, the following hash can be used as seed:
```
[ nonce, raw_username, raw_password ]
```

Where `,` has been used to notate concatenation, and `[ ]` indicates hashing.

For the user to withdraw their funds, they should provide their username and
password to the frontend provider, after which their account UTxO will be
fetched, their account seed constructed, and their key pair generated.

Using the private key of this pair, users can now sign any withdrawal
transactions.

With this solution, users can utilize all the password management solutions
already existing, and therefore offers a smoother onboarding process for less
experienced users.

## Technical Details

The `account` contract relies on the `record` contract, where all registered
accounts are stored in order to guarantee uniqueness of usernames.

`account` works by requiring its info UTxO to be provided as reference, so that
its "reward withdrawal" endpoint can verify the signature once, and allow
multiple datum-less UTxOs to be spent with minimal execution budgets.

The "info UTxO" is authenticated by an NFT from the `record` validator, and a
token name identical to the `username` parameter of the contract, prefixed with
a single byte to distinguish it from the NFT stored in the linked list.

The datum carries user's ED25519 public key, along with the nonce that was
presumably used to generate the key pair.

## User Experience

### Account Creation

1. User provides a username and password, quite like any web2 login page
2. If the username is not already occupied (enforced by an on-chain linked
   list), the platform builds the transaction that consumes the previous
   link/UTxO in the list
3. It uses the output reference of link's UTxO as nonce, concatenates it to the
   provided raw username and raw password, and hashes the result
4. It uses this hash as the seed for generating an ED25519 key pair
5. Store the nonce alongside the verification/public key of the generated pair
6. With the outputs of the transaction now determined, the platform uses the
   acquired private key to sign the outputs, and provide it as the redeemer
7. Submit the transaction

Here it's assumed the platform that's providing this service also provides the
required fee, minimum required ADA for both the account UTxO and list entry
UTxO, and also collateral UTxO(s).

### Deposits

Since each account UTxO is meant to be stored in a dedicated script address,
this address can be used for arbitrary deposits, identical to a simple wallet.

The frontend can either provide a payment platform, a standard for other wallets
to implement, or simply allow users to query their address so that they can
share it with others.

### Withdrawals

1. User types in their username and password, and the funds they want to
   withdraw
2. System hashes the raw username, drops its first byte (since the first byte
   is used to distinguish the list entry's and account's token names), and looks
   to find the UTxO which stores an NFT with this token name
3. The platform uses the stored nonce, along with raw username and password of
   the user to generate the ED25519 key pair
4. Builds the transaction with proper outputs
5. Using user's private key, signs the outputs of this transaction
4. And finalizes the transaction such that the redeemer contains the signature
   that can be verified on-chain using the user's stored public key
